# Project_BO_Solar_RTC
This repository contains the python code that I wrote during my semester project at EPFL. This also includes the support files for the code. 
BO_real_time_sims contans the code for optimizing thickness with real sun spectra instead of AM1.5 g and zenith and azimuth angle .
BO_temperature_effects contains the code for studying the effect of change in temperature thoroghout the year on the solar cell with thickness optimized already by BO_real_time_sims.
